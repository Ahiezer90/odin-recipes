My first project

Hi, This was my first simple project the goal was to build a recipe page with HTML only.

The skills I was able to demonstrate were to master the basic HTML structure,
mastering ordered and unordered lists
Include images and links, paragraphs, headers.
Include the <strong> and <em> element.

Later I will add some styling, with CSS.
Bye.
